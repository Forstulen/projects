Welcome on Nibbler !

	How to Play?

Use the directional arrows to
change your snake direction.
The Space Bar can double your
speed whenever you want!
Press P button to come to a halt.
Press R button to restart.

  	 What is the goal?

Eat all the food you can find.
If you see Bonus, go beat it,
it's really tasty (◕‿‿◕) but I
advice you not to touch the
little poop if it comes...

Of course, this nibbler is the
better one!
